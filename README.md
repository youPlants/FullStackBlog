The username's are compared against the database to prevent duplicate accounts, and the passwords are encrypted and hashed using sha-256 with salt. After registering User's are prompted to personalized welcome page that displays their username.

Each registered user can "like" a blog post written by another user only 1 time, and they are not authorized to like their own posts.
